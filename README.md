Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves the creation, testing, deployment and maintenance of software applications using programming lanaguages. It involves creating apllications with minimal bugs in their code, checking the code regularly to refine it and ensuring that users get a smooth and easy experience whenever they use the applications.
Importance of software engineering
It helps create solutions to different real world problems using technology

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages
The creation of software engineering as a disciplin was in the 1960s
Agile methodologies became a thing in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements gathering: This involves making research and gathering information on users' needs and system requirements.
Implementation: This involves writing the actual code according to the specifications given
Testing: This involves ensuring that the software works properly and meets the standards in quality while also meeting the requirements given
Deployment: This involves releasing the software for users to use
Maintentance: This involves routinely checking for bugs in the code and checking if there are ways to improve the user expericence.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a conventional approach to software development which involves completing the previous step before moving on to the next step. It is a sequential approach which has each phase seperate and flows down like a waterfall. It is usually slower than other methodologies given that you cannot move on to the next step unless the previous step is complete.
Agile methodologies is focues on flexibility and response to change. It involves woring in sprints which are short iterations.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The software developer writes the actual code to implement the solution
THe quality assurance engineer ensures that the software meets the requirements specified by creating test plans
The project manager supervises the project from the beginning to the end and ensures that the project meets the deadline while still ensuring that it is worked on well.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for creating, editing, debugging and testing code. Examples are Atom IDE, VS Code, etc
VCs involves creating tools for tracking changes made by different developers working on the same project. Examples are Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight deadlines

Strategies to overcome

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: This involves testing each indiviual part of the software to ensure that they work properly on their own
Integration testing: This involves testing the way the different components interact with one another and ensuring that they work together seamlessly
System testing: This involes testing the entire software as a whole entity
Acceptance testing: THis onvoles testing that the software meets the user requirements
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves asking an AI model questions, and structuring the question in such a way that the AI is able to give you the best response relevant to your question. It involves being clear and specific, so that the model fully understands exactly what it needs to do.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Give me a food timetable
Corrected prompt: I am a 22 year old Nigerian female with a weight of 56kg living in Lagos, Nigeria. I am trying to increase my weight to at least 60kg without eating junks and unhealthy food, while still eating what I want and not breaking the bank. Create a monthly food timetable for me, incorporating Nigerian foods especially swallows and soups with ingredeients I can easily get around me.

The first prompt is vague and will just generate a random list, but the second prompt is very clear and specifies the age, gender, and location of the timetable user, this will help the model to give foods that are easily accessible to the user. The prompt also makes sure to tell the model the body weight goals of the user so it can tailor the right meal combinations
